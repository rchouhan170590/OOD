The parking lot system designed in `parkin.py` effectively addresses the requirements outlined in `Problem.md`. Here's a breakdown of how the code fulfills each functional requirement:

1. **Parking Spot Types**: The system defines three types of parking spots using the `VehicleSize` enum: `MOTORCYCLE`, `COMPACT`, and `LARGE`. This allows for differentiation between the sizes of vehicles and the corresponding parking spots.

2. **Vehicle Types**: The code includes three vehicle classes: `Motorcycle`, `Car`, and `Bus`, each inheriting from the base `Vehicle` class. Each vehicle is initialized with a specific size that corresponds to the parking spot types.

3. **Parking Logic**: The `ParkingSpot` class has a method `can_fit` that checks if a vehicle can park in a given spot based on its size and availability. The `park_vehicle` method attempts to park a vehicle and records the entry time.

4. **Removing Vehicles**: The `remove_vehicle` method in the `ParkingLot` class allows for the removal of a vehicle from its spot. It calculates the parking fee based on the time parked, which is tracked using timestamps.

5. **Available Spots**: The `available_spots` method allows users to check for available parking spots, optionally filtered by vehicle size.

6. **Summary Reporting**: The `print_summary` method provides an overview of the parking lot's status, including total spots, available spots, and occupied spots.

7. **Fee Structure**: The `ParkingTicket` class calculates the parking fee based on the time a vehicle is parked, using an hourly rate.

8. **Handling Buses**: Although the current implementation does not explicitly handle buses requiring multiple spots, the structure allows for future enhancements where a bus could be assigned to multiple large spots.

Overall, the code is structured to meet the requirements of the parking lot system, ensuring that vehicles can be parked and removed efficiently while tracking fees and available spots.
